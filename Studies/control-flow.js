 * 1) If statement 
 *   'If' is the first step to making a conditional statement chain. 'If' takes in on boolean 
 *   expression, if the expression returns true, the code in the block will be executed
 * 
 * 2) Else-If Statement
 *   If, 'If' conditional expression returns false, you can chain on an else if statement. Else-if 
 *   also takes in a conditional expression that equals true or false. You can chain on multiple
 *   else-if's to test for certain conditions.
 * 
 * 3) Else Statement
 *   Else is the last part of an if-else chain. If none of the prior conditions are met, the code in 
 *   the else block will be executed no matter what.
 * 
 * 4) Switch Statement
 *   The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on conditions. You can select
 *   one of many code blocks to be executed using switch statements.
