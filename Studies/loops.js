 * 1) While Loops
 *   A block of code is repeatedly looped through while a specific condition is true. In order to 
 *   break out of a while loop, you must use a increment or decrement according to the specific 
 *   condition. If you don't you will end up with an infinite loop that never stops and eventually 
 *   crashes your browser.
 * 
 * 2) For Loops
 *   Usually used when you want to run specific code over and over again with a different 
 *   value. Most of the time you will see for loops when dealings with arrays.
 * 
 * 3) For-In Loops
 *   The for in loop loops through the properties of an object. The for in loop iterates over a person
 *   object. Each iteration returns a key (x). The key is used to access the value of the key
 *   The value of the key is person[x].
